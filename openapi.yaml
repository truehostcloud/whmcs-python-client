    Python client for the WHMCS API.
    
    WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) provides a single API endpoint that handles
    multiple operations through different 'action' parameters. This specification presents
    each action as an independent path while routing all requests to the /api.php endpoint.

x-whmcs-config:
  singleEndpoint: true
  actualPath: /api.php
  description: |
    This OpenAPI spec uses virtual paths for different WHMCS actions, but all requests
    should be sent to the actual /api.php endpoint. The client implementation should:
    1. Route all requests to /api.php regardless of the path in this spec
    2. Automatically inject the 'action' parameter based on the operation
    3. Merge the base request fields with action-specific fields
