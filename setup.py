    OpenAPI specification for the WHMCS API endpoints.  This specification uses discriminators to properly handle polymorphic request/response schemas. The 'action' field serves as the discriminator property to differentiate between different request and response types (AddClient, UpdateClient, AddOrder).   # noqa: E501
