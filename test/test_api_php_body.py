    WHMCS API

    Python client for the WHMCS API.  WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) provides a single API endpoint that handles multiple operations through different 'action' parameters. This client supports various WHMCS operations for managing clients, orders, and other resources.  Authentication is handled through username/password or API credentials. All requests are sent as form-encoded data to the /api.php endpoint.   # noqa: E501
